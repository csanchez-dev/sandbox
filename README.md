# 🧪 Sandbox  
**A personal development playground for experiments, prototypes, and curiosity-driven learning.**

## 🚀 About This Repo
This is where I test ideas, break things, and explore new technologies.  
Nothing here is final — it’s a safe space to try, learn, and sharpen my engineering skills across multiple domains.

You’ll find experiments in:

- **Web Development** (HTML, CSS, JS, frameworks)  
- **Backend & APIs**  
- **Scripting** (Python, Bash, Node)  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
- **Tools & DevOps**  
- **Anything else I’m curious about**

---

## 🧱 Purpose
- Rapid prototyping  
- Skill sharpening  
- Tool exploration  
- “Let me try this real quick” coding  
- Notes, drafts, and in-progress ideas

---

## 📌 Notes
- Code quality varies — experiments aren’t polished on purpose.  
- If something breaks… perfect. That means I’m learning.  
- Organized into folders so future me doesn’t suffer (too much).

## 🔥 Keep Experimenting
This repo evolves as I grow. New tools, new languages, new challenges — all in one place.
