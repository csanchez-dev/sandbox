🧪 Sandbox

A personal development playground for experiments, prototypes, and curiosity-driven learning.

🚀 About This Repo

This is where I test ideas, break things, and explore new technologies.
Nothing here is final — it’s a safe space to try, learn, and sharpen my engineering skills across multiple domains.

You’ll find experiments in:

Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS, frameworks)

Backend & APIs

Scripting (Python, Bash, Node)

Data Structures & Algorithms

Tools & DevOps

Anything else I’m curious about

🧱 Purpose

Rapid prototyping

Skill sharpening

Tool exploration

“Let me try this real quick” coding

Notes, drafts, and in-progress ideas

📌 Notes

Code quality varies — experiments aren’t polished by design.

If something breaks… perfecto. That means I’m learning.

Organized into folders so future me doesn’t suffer (too much).

📩 Contributions

Not open for contributions — this is a personal lab.
But you’re welcome to explore, fork, or take inspiration.

🔥 Keep Experimenting

This repo evolves as I grow. New tools, new languages, new challenges — all in one place.
